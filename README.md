# pileup
attention management proto-tool.

This is a small note-taking and organizing application made with d3.js, python, and CouchDB.

The user interface is based around the idea of dragging small notes onto piles (which are portals to new pages with other piles on them, etc).

I am currently in the process of porting a version of this to smalltalk.

See the youtube video about it here:
